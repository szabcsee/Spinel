# [Spinel](http://www.digitalyogis.com/spinel)
Spinel: A light-weight UI Starter-Kit for Mobile-Friendly Development http://www.digitalyogis.com/spinel to kickstart responsive projects (mainly on Rails).

Check out <http://www.digitalyogis.com/spinel> for documentation and details.

## Getting started
Currently there is only one way to get started:
- Clone the repo: _git clone https://github.com/szabcsee/Spinel.git_ (Note: this is under active development, so if you're looking for stable and safe, use the zipped download)


### What's in the download?

The download includes Spinel's CSS, Normalize CSS as a reset, a sample favicon, and an index.html as a starting point.

```
Spinel/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   ├── normalize.min.css
│   └── spinel.css
└── images/
    └── favicon.ico

```

### Why it's awesome

Spinel is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.
- No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS


## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. Spinel works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.
